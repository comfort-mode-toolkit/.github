## üöß Work In Progress!

**Heads up:** Comfort Mode Toolkit is a living project‚Äîresearch, tools, and docs here are a **work in progress**!  
We‚Äôre always iterating, learning, and adding new things. Your feedback and contributions shape where we go next.

## What is Comfort Mode?

Comfort Mode is a set of tools, research, and practices designed to:
- **Let users control how websites look and feel,** so they can browse in a way that's truly comfortable for them.
- Go beyond ‚Äúbare minimum‚Äù accessibility, focusing on **personalization, comfort, and real user needs.**

Our work spans:
- **Scaling & Spacing:** Smart defaults that adapt to user needs (not just ‚Äúmake it bigger!‚Äù).
- **Motion & Animation:** Helping sites feel lively but never overwhelming (and always optional).
- **Research:** Gathering evidence and real user stories to inform every decision.
- **Open-source tools:** Python CLI utilities, docs, and more!
